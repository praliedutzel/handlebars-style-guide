# handlebars-style-guide

If you're building a static style guide, a templating language might be just be the helping hand you need. This code serves as a starting point for building static style guides with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), a JavaScript templating language that makes it easy to create reusable templates and apply them across a number of pages.

You can learn more about how I use this over on [my blog](http://bit.ly/handlebars-style-guide). Feel free to fork the project and see if it will work for your own projects!
